In this guide we are going to show you how to tag text with the PyMUSAS [NeuralTagger](/api/spacy_api/taggers/neural#neuraltagger) so that you can extract token level [USAS semantic tags](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/) from the tagged text. The guide will first introduce the Neural Tagger by using the smallest English Neural Tagger as part of a spaCy pipeline, then we will introduce how to use the multilingual tagger, and finally how to use the Neural tagger outside of a spaCy pipeline.
